credit card fraud detection using random forest algorithm
In proposed system we use Random Forest Algorithm(RFA) for finding the fraudulent transactions and the accuracy of those transactions. This algorithm is based on supervised learning algorithm where it uses decision trees for classification of the dataset. After classification of dataset a confusion matrix is obtained.
