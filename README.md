# credit card fraud detection using random forest algorithm
 Credit card fraud is an unauthorized transaction done without your credit card. Thieves access the credit card credentials by phishing or credit card skimming. So by detecting such fraud, customers will not be charged for the items they did not purchase.
In proposed system we use Random Forest Algorithm(RFA) for finding the fraudulent transactions and the accuracy of those transactions. This algorithm is based on supervised learning algorithm where it uses decision trees for classification of the dataset. After classification of dataset a confusion matrix is obtained.
