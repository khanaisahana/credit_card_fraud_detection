# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Random Forest Algorithm
 
## Goals:
To detect fraudulent transactions in credit card data <br>
To prevent unauthorized transactions and protect customers from financial loss <br>
To improve the accuracy and speed of detecting fraudulent transactions <br>

## Process:
Data collection: Gather credit card transaction data from various sources <br>
Data preprocessing: Clean the data, remove duplicates and irrelevant information, and transform it into a suitable format for analysis <br>
Feature selection: Identify the most important features that can help distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions <br>
Model training: Train the Random Forest algorithm on the labeled dataset, with fraud and non-fraud transactions <br>
Model testing: Test the trained model on a separate, labeled dataset to evaluate its performance <br>
Model deployment: Integrate the model into the existing credit card transaction system to automatically detect and flag potentially fraudulent transactions <br>
Monitoring and improvement: Continuously monitor the system for accuracy and make necessary updates to the algorithm and data as needed <br>

## Features:
Random Forest algorithm for classification of credit card transactions <br>
Supervised learning approach for detecting fraud <br>
Confusion matrix for evaluating the model's accuracy <br>
Automatic detection and flagging of potentially fraudulent transactions <br>
Real-time monitoring of transactions for increased security and prevention of financial loss <br>
